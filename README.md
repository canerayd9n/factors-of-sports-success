# Sports Success and Socioeconomic Factors

## 🎯 Research Question
> What are the main factors behind a country's sports success?

This project explores the relationship between sports achievements and several socioeconomic indicators such as GDP per capita, population, youth ratio, and education level.

## 📊 Description
The goal is to identify whether economic power, population size, or demographic structure have a stronger correlation with sports performance (e.g., total Olympic medals or FIFA rankings).

---

## 🧠 Hypothesis
- H1: Countries with higher GDP per capita tend to achieve greater sports success.  
- H2: A larger youth population positively influences sports achievements.
